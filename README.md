HOW TO RUN THE TITIKMAN APP

1. Install Dependencies 
There are frontend and backend dependencies. 

For the FRONTEND you will need to download the following via npm install: 
- axios 
- bootstrap-react 
- js-cookie


For the BACKEND you will need to download the following via npm install: 
- aws-sdk 
- cookie-parser 
- cors
- dotenv 
- express-session
- mongoose
- multer
- path
- bcrypt

2. Run the app after installing dependencies 
(Assuming you are in the correct directory)

1. cd backend 
2. npm run dev 
3. cd .. 
4. cd frontend 
5. npm start 

This will allow you to access localhost:3000 as the frontend client side and will request to localhost:4000 as the backend server running on MongoDB alongside a cloud storage from AWS S3.
